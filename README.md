# Java Grep App
  ## Introduction
  This app try to mimic Unix command called `grep` which stands for `global regular expression print`.This app searches for the text pattern or regular expression recursively in the given given directory and output the matched  lines to a temp file.
  ## Usage
  To run the following app open up Intellij and click on edit configuration on top left of the IDE and type the argument `.*data.* /home/dev/jrvs/bootcamp/ /tmp/grep.out` in program parameters separated by space.

  It searches all the files in `/home/dev/jrvs/bootcamp/`  directory , sub directory and looks for the key word data and output it to file located in tmp folder with the fine name of `grep.out`.
  ##### Note: You can also search for different keyword instead of data.
  ##### For Example: Lets say you have stored your password somewhere in the directory but you do not know where it is. Instead of opening all the file and checking if it is there which is time consuming, we can make use of this such application that will output the result in milliseconds by onlu chnaging the regex pattern to `.*password.*`.
